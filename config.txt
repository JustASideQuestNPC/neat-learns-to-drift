[CAR] # Many of these variables have specified ranges, but the program DOES NOT enforce them. Setting a variable to a value outside the recommended range voids your warranty.

    [[CONTROL]]  # Constants for control and basic physics.
    MAX_SPEED = 4           # Maximum forward speed.
    TURN_SPEED_MULT = 0.25  # Adjusts maximum speed as angle delta increases during a turn. Maximum speed is directly multiplied by this value at maximum intensity

    POINT_SCALAR = 1.5    # Determines how high the angle delta must become before grip begins to increase. Higher values cause a higher delay.
    GRIP_EXP = 1.3        # Determines how "tight" the grip curve is, which determines how quickly grip increases during a turn. Lower values cause a slower, more gradual increase, while higher values cause a more rapid "snap". Setting this to 0 or below WILL crash the program.
